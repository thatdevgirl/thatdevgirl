My name is **Joni** and I am a "middle-end" web developer who loves to write code, commit often, and make up her own titles.

## About me

* I have a full time gig @ [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu) and a pre-schooler at home. ðŸ‘¶
* I am self-publishing my first picture book, _[Sweet Little You](https://jhalabi.com/book/)_, coming summer 2022!
* I learned to code in BASIC on an Apple iiC.
* I still have that Apple iiC _(though, sadly, it no longer works)_.
* My favorite programming languages these days are Javascript, PHP, and... more Javascript.
* I am on Team Oxford Comma. Don't @ me.
