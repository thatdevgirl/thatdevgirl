My name is **Joni** and I am a "middle-end" web developer who loves to write code, commit often, and make up her own titles.

## About me

* I have a full time gig @ [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu) and a toddler at home. ðŸ‘¶
* I learned to code in BASIC on an Apple iiC.
* I still have that Apple iiC _(though, sadly, it no longer works)_.
* My favorite programming languages these days are Javascript, PHP, and... more Javascript.
* I am on Team Oxford Comma. Don't @ me.

## Where can you find me?

* Blogging on my [website](https://jhalabi.com)
* Speaking at [conferences](https://talks.thatdevgirl.com)
* Occasionally tweeting at [@jonihalabi](https://twitter.com/jonihalabi)
