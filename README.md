My name is **Joni** and I am a "middle-end" web developer who loves to write code, commit often, and make up her own titles.

## About me

* I have a full time gig @ [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu) and a pre-schooler at home. ðŸ‘¶
* I am the author of _[Sweet Little You](https://jhalabi.com/book)_, a welcome baby picture book for single parents with donor-conceived kids.
* I learned to code in BASIC on an Apple iiC.
* I still have that Apple iiC _(though, sadly, it no longer works)_.
* My favorite programming languages these days are JavaScript, PHP, and... more JavaScript.
* I am on Team Oxford Comma. Don't @ me.
